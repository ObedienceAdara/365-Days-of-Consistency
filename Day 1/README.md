# ðŸŒŸ Day 1 of 365 Days of Consistency ðŸŒŸ

Just wrapped up the first day of my year-long consistency challenge, and Iâ€™m excited to share what Iâ€™ve been up to! Today, I built a Telegram bot that summarizes documents. ðŸ“‘ðŸ¤–

It was a lot of fun diving into the code and making it all come together. I used the sumy library to handle the text summarization and python-telegram-bot for the Telegram integration. Learned a bunch along the way, from text processing to API calls.

Canâ€™t wait to see where this journey takes me and what Iâ€™ll learn next. Hereâ€™s to more days of building and experimenting!
